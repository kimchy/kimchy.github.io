My name is Shay Banon. I am the creator of [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org), the open source, distributed, RESTful, search engine. I am also the founder of the [company](http://www.elasticsearch.com) behind it. Before creating Elasticsearch, I spent more than a decade building distributed systems and open source search.
