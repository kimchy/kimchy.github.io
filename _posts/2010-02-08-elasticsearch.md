Well, the gig is out. What I have been working on for the past several months is now alive. [ElasticSearch](http://elasticsearch.org) is an open source, distributed, RESTful search engine. More info about it can be found in the [You Know, for Search](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/you-know-for-search/) blog post.

How does that relates to Compass? Good question, which deserves a proper blog post. I will be maintaining another [blog](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/) just for ElasticSearch, and also there is a [twitter](http://twitter.com/elasticsearch), you should follow.

Enjoy!
