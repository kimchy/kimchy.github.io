After four great years of working at GigaSpaces, I am leaving to pursue my own venture. Working at GigaSpaces is certainly one of the best things I have done in my professional life, and leaving is not a simple decision. The people, the technology, and the innovation at GigaSpaces is amazing, and I am proud to have taken part in it.

What is next for me? As most people probably know, my technical love is search. Starting with Compass, and now with ElasticSearch, I am trying to build open source solutions that help get app level search functionality into any application easily (as most apps, if not all of them, need it ;) ). That is why I am going to start and build something around it (specially, elasticsearch), but on that, I think a different blog post is in order.
