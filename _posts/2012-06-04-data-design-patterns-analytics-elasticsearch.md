A talk I gave at [Berlin Buzzwords](http://berlinbuzzwords.de) about data design patterns and analytics with [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org).

Side note, the title of the talk is completely messed up, decided a day before the conference to create a fresh talk about a more technically interesting topic... .
